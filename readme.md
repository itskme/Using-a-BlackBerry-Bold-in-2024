# Making the BlackBerry Bold 9900 Usable in 2024

---

The BlackBerry bold was launched over a decade ago as BlackBerry's flagship device before the indroduction of the BlackBerry10 OS. I recently saved one from e-waste and was fascinated by the keyboard and touchpad and touchscreen. It was a strange time in mobile technology, but blackberry managed to make it work with this slick device.

So what can we do with it in 2024? Well:

* Play most web-radio broadcasts

* Browse the web (even GitHub)

* Text and call on 2G/3G

* Listen to audiobooks

* Use it as an offline MP3 player

...And much more! You just need to know how to do it.
