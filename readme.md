# Making the BlackBerry Bold 9900 Usable in 2024

---

The BlackBerry bold was launched over a decade ago as BlackBerry's flagship device before the indroduction of the BlackBerry10 OS. I recently saved one from e-waste and was fascinated by the keyboard and touchpad and touchscreen. It was a strange time in mobile technology, but blackberry managed to make it work with this slick device.

So what can we do with it in 2024? Well:

* Play most web-radio broadcasts

* Browse the web (even GitHub)

* Text and call on 2G/3G

* Listen to audiobooks

* Use it as an offline MP3 player

...And much more! You just need to know how to do it.

# Getting Started

1. Connect your Bold to the internet.

2. Go to http://darkstar.x10host.com/nibble/ on the default browser of your Bold.

3. Install the application

4. Browse the menus using the touchpad or touchscreen

5. Download whichever apps you please!



# A Note on Security

**Note that any app running on this device in 2024 is not secure. Especially email/IM where sensitive data can be intercepted. I do not reccomend using this device for such tasks.**



# Apps I Tested

Below are my reccomendations for working apps which can be downloaded from the link above. More apps may work, you will have to test yourself.

### Browser

Opera Mini is the only choice here. No default configurations are really needed. Through this browser you can even access GitHub(although the website is broken.)

### Music

The Bold is great for web-radio. For this I reccomend Nobex. To use the app, simply enter your email address and start listening! No authentication necessary. **Note that some stations will not work, for these try downlaoding TuneIn from the website.**



# More Information

**You can always browse [The Bold Explorer](http://darkstar.x10host.com/nibble/)** on your desktop to see more detailed information. Access it with the link above.



# Enjoy!
